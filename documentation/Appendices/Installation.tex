\section{Installing \& Configuring the Tool}
The tool can be cloned from the official repository: \href{https://gitlab.com/labiangashi/pgsynthdata}{https://gitlab.com/labiangashi/pgsynthdata}.\\

After the cloning is complete, the user must install all the dependencies that are contained in a file called \textit{requirements.txt}, they can be downloaded with a single terminal command. When that is done, your environment will be ready to use the tool (of course, you need a PostgreSQL database server instance too).\\

The tool can be run using the shell terminal and the usage of the tool is explained more thoroughly in the \nameref{a:tool_usage} appendix.
