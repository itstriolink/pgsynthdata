I would like to express my greatest gratitude towards my advisor \href{mailto:stefan.keller@hsr.ch}{Prof. Stefan Keller} for suggesting me this seminar to me and assisting me throughout the whole journey with his patient guidance and enthusiastic encouragement. \\

A huge thanks also goes to \href{mailto:johannes.wildermuth@hsr.ch}{Johannes Wildermuth} from the institute of HSR who helped me by supplying me with the first code scaffold for the tool. \\

Another special thanks goes to all the authors of the Python libraries and LateX templates that I used in order to complete this project. I would also like to send some appreciation to the GitLab team for having such a nice and neat application lifecycle tool for me to utilize. It provided me with a very comfortable code repository, CI/CD pipeline features and just generally a nice and consistent environment to have my application on.
