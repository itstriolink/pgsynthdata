Creation of realistic synthetic data is a challenging but important aspect of testing machine learning (ML) application and data science projects. The need for such data is constantly rising with the increase of the application of machine learning in different business functions.\\
\newline
There does not exist a lot of literature regarding synthetic data generation in the virtual world yet, the reason is that it is a pretty new concept for data engineers. This means that synthetic data generation is still in a "tabula rasa" state and the generation of such data can be done using many arbitrary approaches.\\
\newline
The idea or approach for this tool is creating a light-weight \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)}{Python} application that collaborates with the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL}{PostgreSQL} database management system and uses real or realistic data contained in the PostgreSQL server in order to produce fully synthetic data. This generated data is not just anonymized data, but it rather advances even a step further by taking the shape and statistics of the real data and generating a set of data that has no direct association with the real data, but has the same or similar shape and feel of the real data.\\
\newline
The tool is very straight-forward to use and requires only the database connection parameters and the database containing the real data, every other function is done by the tool. It tries to simplify the process of generating synthetic data that can be used for testing maching learning applications or different data science projects. It is also easy and not cumbersome to set-up and has all the logic encapsulated within only a couple of scripts.\\
